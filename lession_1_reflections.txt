How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

 We can spot the changes faster and easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

For one, it saves space. Second, it is easily and more convinience to find the files in one place. Less clutter, more productive.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Saving multiple files in one commit show you the relation between a change in one file to other file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    first type git log to show the previous commits and then use git diff firstcommit secondcommit to show the differences between the two.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can always go back in time to restore your previous working commit.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will use git for my iOS and Android app developement projects.
